# Resources for panel discussion on blended learning

![Cover](images/cover.png)


Thanks for your interest in participating in this panel. I will be in touch with next steps on scheduling and other logistics. Will also create a blog post and marketing campaign for the online event.

In the meantime, you can review the proposed questions in the Word doc here. They will be shared with participants as part of the slide deck during the event. 


I am looking forward to the program and a special thanks for Shilpam for coordinating all the panelists and more!
